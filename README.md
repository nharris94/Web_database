# Final-Project
Final Project for Advanced Practical Computer Concepts for Bioinformatics

This program allows a user to search to search a database and returns the results in tabular form.

# database_upload.py

The database upload file takes the awo.owl file and enters the information into the selected database table.
The table must be created before the database_upload.py file is run.

# Database Search

To search the database a parameter must be selected from the drop down menu beforehand.
For the name parameter, an alternate name may be entered as well. 
But if there are any matches with the search term with the unofficial name, the synonym table will not be searched.
